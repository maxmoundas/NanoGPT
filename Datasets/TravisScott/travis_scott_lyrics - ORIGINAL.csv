I trade all my Molly, I pop me a freak
I bought me a 'Vet, I crash every week
Up in the party, you know that we geeked
Lean-lean-lean, we don't wanna sleep
No I do not want your dope, keep that shit away from me
Now that I got all the gas, know that my gas always stink
Hannah Montanna and beans, know that my trap full of fiends
No I do not fuck with twelve, call up the 10s and let's link
Look at your shoes, Margielas are better
Look at your crew, you gotta do better
50s are better, 40s are better
30s are better, 20s are better

With no pantyhose for me, I hit 'em and go to sleep
She said she know DJ Spinz, she must be a 10
He pass 'em to me, I pass 'em back to him
10s and up, back of the truck
She swallow the drugs, she gimme a hug, she know what's up
She wanna fuck, we just met in the club
Now she on my rug (Ahaha)

I'm floatin' high, don't talk to me
I'm rollin' high, don't bother me
So follow me, yeah, come and follow me
In the night streets, dim the lights, please

[Verse 1]
What the fuck they want? I'm drunk as hell
Fuck work today, I wanna get some tail
Damn my little nigga graduated, man, I wish him well Now there's no more breaking them pies
And making that bail for them scales
Step across that fence and that's your life
When I run that town, that whip about town size
Four chains, they hang on my neck, was dipped in that brown rice
You think something wrong 'cause your shit don't shine bright
But ain't nothing wrong 'cause your shit don't shine bright

[Chorus]
I'm floatin' high, don't talk to me
I'm rollin' high, don't bother me
So follow me, yeah, come and follow me
In the night streets, dim the lights, please

[Verse 2]
It was Friday, what a night, what a situation
My nigga Chase momma called cause he missed that graduation
He told her, ""Momma please, have a drink, have a little bit patience
'Cause soon we would be riding in a car with a little ventilation""
Pastor said that we gotta move to congregation
I'm looking for salvation, but I'm drowning in the revelations
XX revolution, this inauguration to the whole nation
If it ain't no head, no sex, then it's masturbation

I don't know about you
Feel like I'm floating through the night
Slow move to the groove
Often the feeling feels right
(Dance like a 90s baby)
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
Feel like I'm floating through traffic
(Then it ""poof"" like magic)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
This shit be the coldest
Wake up nigga, smell the Folgers
Fuck she throwing up last night
Only if the dumb bitch did what I told her (Told her)
She feel me, I feel her
And she even let me move my fingers up her skirt
Fuck it live for the moment
Had no bread, now the hoes spread like toast is
Her legs spread like Moses
On my way, raise your glass we can have a toast
To the same ones that love talking that wild shit
Be the same ones who wanna be around the most
Tony said soon enough niggas will have a two-tone
Two blond chicks with the roof gone
Complaining now that her breasts out
Well at least you could've thought to put the mink on

Wet dreams with the prom queen
Now I'm tryna screw me a centerfold
Every nigga have their wild dreams
Mines is to fly to the summer in my winter clothes
Sin city is a mile away
I see the devil in a skirt, but it's a nightgown
Hallelujah, does it even matter if it's night or day
When we pull up, she gon' pull her shirt down
This where we find 'em
Same niggas that sniff Donna
And get drunk off the mimosa
Space green or designer
Hermes based off of drama
Call it spendin' yoda
Six years catch me trying yoga
In the Caesar Palace rocking a toga
Throwing a toga party
Chilling with your bitch and she extra naughty
[Chorus]
I don't know about you
I don't know about you
(Dance like a 90s, baby)
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
Feel like I'm floating through traffic
(Then it ""poof"" like magic)
I don't know about you
Feel like I'm floating through the night
Slow move to the groove
Often the feeling feels right

Nah, the dawgs ain't civilized, take the one, feel vilified
You can't see my sons, like the light don't hit they side
In the function and I'm fried, this strive is not a drive
When they open wide, it's a riot, riot

People tryna say I'm only into me
Got a code with my dawgs, can't get in between

The stars are out tonight
Let 'em fall over you
If I run away tonight
I blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
And we gon' fly to Vegas
We gon' raise them glasses when I finally make it
And go home and hit up all the places
Where a nigga grew up and see these bitches I dated
So eager, to treat us like Caesars
I'mma catch amnesia, they gon' have they D's up
So I might remember, when the nights was dimmer
Had nobody to look to, older brother was iller
Seen the look in his eyes, then see straight to her soul
What he feeling inside, damn I never would know

The preacher at the altar to tell you to have a taste
White wine, go ahead and sip your race
And walk in the closet and feel amazed
Ain't no retire, fall out of line and we get to pacin
And we gonna simply reside and fill up the space and
Took the travis may leave you around and place it
That's a classic, no other way to have it
Remember me and my brother slept on that mattress
And look how many bitches piled up on that mattress
I'm feeling too proud, cause all my niggas around
I gotta prove it right now waitin' for ‘em to feel it
It was cool for a second, but now might take a minute
Cause now I'm in the building, god damn, I'm about to kill it

Nothing short of an assassin, garments I stick my ass in
Kill niggas dead on the scene, no casket
Basking in my glory on the 37th story of a highrise
Ten hoes, nice thighs, mai tais
Serving umbrellas, but I knew the perfect fellow
So impressive, she would this Beretta if I let her
Have a blast of a lifetime, ass of a lifetime
I swear this dick I give her it'll last her a lifetime
A nice night selling hard rock in the pipeline
Put in their life and now they love a nigga longtime

Loved the jail, it was better in the cell
Did a little crime, too that shit never ever tell

First she started gargling, and end up swallowing
And went to class too and got some knowledge
You fucking with the devil like she over popping him

Yuh, yuh, yuh

[Verse 1]
Gon' grab that fifth, grab that eighth, grab what you need
Blow that dope, don't get too high
From the Third Coast to the West Coast, come, take this ride
Let me tell the tale of how Jacques turned Scott
Over one lost trip to the sky
Let me tell the tale 'cause you told the tale
When you said I could make it this high
Who knew?
Goddammit, who knew?
The grass ain't greener on the other side, it's just blue
You can really identify when you lookin' in your eyes
You ready to ride, that's true
When they look in my eyes, they see that real
How Scotty entired that juice, had my back against that wall
Every summer felt so cold, my daddy ain't comin' home 'til Fall
That's why my pimp game so moist, had that du-rag and all
Had a 20-year-old bitch in high school
Wasn't no tellin' what Travy might do
On the south side of that H-O-U
Hol' up, let's take it back to that room, no car but still had drive
Just a hundred niggas standin' outside
Life's a beach with lot of sand on the lot
I'ma ride for all of my niggas, they forever here by my side

Never sit around, just workin', it was worth it
That's for certain, I deserve it
Lord knows we don't get tired, been through more dirt than a derby
Mama worked for AT&T, and we still ain't get that service
She stayed in/out the hospital, you know that made me nervous
Still step out the house to smell so fresh, fresh like detergent

In MO city they know the gang (Oh)
Young La Flame, ain't nothin' changed
But the chains and diamond rings

[Verse 2]
Diamond rings, I lost my brains
Me and Ye Ye out in broad day
I'm on the 3rd coast
Eatin' Burlow with Merlot (Straight up)
I got my shirt off
Kickin' dirt off out in Bergdorf (La Flame)
She like, ""What you doin'?"" (Doin')
It took a path just to get me here
Don't give a damn if that's ruined (Ruined)
Later on got a ring, ring, ring
She at my doorbell, ""ding-ding-ding-ding""
Let the bitch in, the bitch seen
Bang out, bang out
On the couch, on the floor, in her mouth
Camera's out (Camera's out)
Once my dick's in, no pulling out (No pulling out)

That's my baby (Straight up)
Bitch been doing coke since the '80s (That dope)
I'm a '90s baby (La Flame)
Young La Flame, you know he crazy

[Chorus]
Ayy (Straight up, straight up)
All this money on the table, ooh
We don't want relations
We don't want no conversations

I just poured an eight in a liter
Throw some Jolly Rancher in, make it sweeter
Versace my clothes, I'm with a white ho
And she snortin' three lines like Adidas
Got a black girl rollin' off molly
Got a white bitch snortin' up snow
Say she want real niggas in the party
Parents gon' leave the keys to the condo

[Post-Chorus: NAV]
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose (That coca)
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more
[Verse 1: NAV]
I just poured an eight in a liter
With a white bitch sniffin' on Bieber
Are you sure you wanna party with the demons?
Bitch, lookin' for her phone, I ain't seen it
Told Frost, ""Bring the water,"" no Fiji
Free Stix, I'm poured up and I'm leanin'
I got a couple pussy niggas in they feelings
'Cause the main bitch wanna come see me
She said she want more, your girl is a ho
You need to let go, she fucked all my bros
She snortin' the snow (That coca), now she touchin' her toes
She got Anna Nicole all in her nose
If they kick down the door, we gon' get locked for sure
She said she want more, fuck it, I'ma get more (I'ma get more)

Gets in a car accident

Playing instrumental to ""the ends""
Travis: Spoken
Dimness, my old brother
I can feel whispers flying over endless rain of meaningless chaos
Reality always exceed fiction
I can see an unborn generation
I can hear within the silence and see within the nothingness
Flashing neon lights trying to disturb and throw off my fucking judgment
Past, present, and future all melted in a nonending circle
Hear my words of temptation and redemption
They made me believe I could escape
Remember this shit, remember me, the one who die here
It's time to live

Cactus Trails Escape,"3 ContributorsCactus Trails Escape LyricsNow, I’m lost, Jacques Berman Webster II, most definitely lost
I see the needle sway and they tell me I’m all I got. This is my name, so, this is who I must be, I should listen. This is just an intro to myself, that much is clear. And if I can go get away from myself, I might find something worth bringing back home, but my problem is that my mind is moving at max speed. The air is moving slower the faster my feet move. My Air Max 270s keep me grounded to this hypothetical floor. I’m hovering at the layer between what’s real and what I made up, which are the same being that much I know. And I should be lost on purpose, intention, made it across the universe like perfect, made you wish rehearsed it because it really does look so perfect. My imagination is a burden that has me lost and uncertain, but what nourishes me is Houston. What’s the difference between being lost and escaping? An attention. What’s the difference between a ladder and an elevator? Labor. Feel free to feel lost, it’s free, there’s no cost. The cacti fell over on the path, that’s how I noticed I can fly. The truth is, your always home. I create a city with no buildings or people, just deep breaths and daydreams, nightmares and ancestors’ energies fly and memory. I can get away, I can make it, whether it’s outdated and I’m Jaded, or I become the air and I made it. It maxed out our system like I twisted the mission and made the decision to be free or like other people who can’t see it, they call it, they say I’m lost now.

Moonlight move when a nigga dance
Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasn't working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can't wait
In the moonlight, you can't see my eyes
And when I'm off the things I can't think
Man I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can't choke
When they recognize a real nigga still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat

Lost in the moonlight, run through the moonlight, who knew?
Cop lights, no lights, 'cause the bills they was overdue
Now a skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking trips to the side of the moon
Had to take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed a little cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, you don't wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I'm on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just gon' cruise hit the brews, lay back don't worry 'bout shit
It might get rowdy 'cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can't be realer, me and my niggas in the villa
She in that white dress it can't fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it and she on the moon my nigga

Paul Wall, two cups, hold up, hold up
I'm headed to the moon 'cause the world screwed up
Like the city, I grew up so
I'm pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you spill my cup, it'll get you fucked up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG
In the triple D, I'm full when I'm on E, you don't know nothing 'bout me
Backwood feel with a Compton tree
Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt but I ain't no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco, piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that shit
Def' rocking link, what you know about this
Baby Bash came through with the kush assist
Percocet ten and a soma twist on the moon
Getting higher than a bitch and I'm doing my dance

Kiss my momma for me if you get a chance

And when I’m off the things I can’t think

Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope

Still impatient, still sippin' on liquor
Still rollin' up Swishers

On your girl rubbin' on my favorite features
How could they tease us? Only wanted Ben Franklins and Mona Lisas

Too bad I couldn't three-peat her
Need a whole lotta vida 'fore I see the reaper

Dust,"29 ContributorsDust Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ashes, dust to dust
Death all on her mind, don't let her fuck it up
Fucking with these hoes make you put it up
At least Adam and Eve got to bust a nut
High of the blow just bought another nose
And I might pull off in that Ghost like where that nigga go?
Doctor gave her double D's cause she heard a nigga flow
Whoa, she move the nigga aside cause he ain't important
She turn that
Cigarette to ash and watch it hit the dust
Girl quit playing yeah you know that nigga boring
Not too many in leather pants that can fuck with us
Now let us dance while I throw the dust
Ashes, to dust to dust
Know they all throw they hands cause they fuck with us
So many bitches bob and weave but they don't bob enough
Now these bitches mad look what I done started up
Put that whip outside, I hit the key it started up
I told them kiss my ass while I hit the dust
I hit the weed then I hit the gas
So much gold you think a nigga broke
So we gon' pull of trunk first so that you niggas know
With an Irish centerfold but all she know is Adido
Damn my momma proud a nigga made it out the moat
Where the sun always shine yeah but not no more
We party in the jungle till its time to go
So everybody rumble as they hit the floor

What a crazy night, I ran away from home just to change my life
Remember when my niggas told me them owls came out at night
So now we bout to touch the sky, just to play in the night
Caught me standing now I'm in there standing, we staying the night
Daddy left but that nigga never said goodnight
Man that wasn't right, now I want all the power
Expected a lot from that coward
And any second I'm bound to wow ya, all them beats I dealt
For like two years momma all them beats I felt
I can massage my own dick I don't need your help
And I can crash my own whip, I don't need your belt
Tell me where the fuck was you when I couldn't feed myself
And all that wack shit help me be myself

Went through fuckin' you with no protection

Made fourteen million, just because, like the Simpsons
Geeked from whatever's in my drink, I feel the symptoms
Back-to-back Lambos on the road, I think I'm trippin'
Think that they can pop up on the bros? I don't get it
Open up the doors and flood the floor so they can witness
How we breakin' every record at the Guinness
Once I take one down, it don't take long for it to kick in (Woo-woo-woo-woo)
Just to kick in
She been bouncin' that for way too long, got motion sickness
I see you at LIV on every song, but you religious
Did it in my office, fuck the crib, got straight to business
Night watch, up top, out in Bеverly Hills with baps, it ain't no bops
We didn't have to gеt the pin, we got the drop
When they pay, don't want the cash, I'll take the stock

You can tell by way I wear the watch who really winnin'
Your life like that Rollie you bust down, it's really tickin' (Tick-tock, tick-tock)

Ain't gotta finesse out the midway
So Bird can wrap birds in that Ben-Gay
No more, goddamn
And Pops never gave me shit
But Pops ain't raised no bitch
I swung, I missed, he swung, he hit, then I hit that ditch
Raised in a town where it looked so good outside
Like it ain't that serious
My nigga got dumb years doing dumb shit
Locked up in the car, had to pull a gun quick
Killa tatted on his face, leaked to his conscious
Now he stuck in a cell, know he feeling nauseous

We did drugs in the bedroom (Bedroom)

It's a hell of a night for Heaven's sakes
All you see is mountain and clouds, can't hit the brakes (Brakes)
She hit me twice in the face, there goes the base
She like to lift her nylon skirt to show the lace (Lace)
She say she love me but don't know what love is
I lost love 'cause my daddy said it but ain't ever done shit
Pain is love and love is hell (Uh)
I might need some bail if this shit don't sell (Sell)
Hand on my dick while I'm coastin' up the Fiji
Slow motionin' through emotion, tint in case a nigga see me
They'll come and feed you but that felt a little easy
I brought the squeegee case it get a little greasy (Greasy)
After a moment I fell into the mist
She reminisce a nigga style, God damn a nigga rich (Rich)
Wine and cigarettes under a light
Said she lost that angel done turned into a hell of a night (Night)

Okay, this shit is outta control

It's shinin' in here, then I done brought glow
I hear the sirens right out the chateau, run me the info
Tryna hear what you did, not how you came close
'Cause I get bobblehead like I done made pro
I made Italian bread like I done made dough

Write a show 'bout myself like I'm Chelsea Handler
Or write a series 'bout my bitches like I'm Kelsey Grammer
Nicknamed the jet Jayhawk 'cause it's outta Kansas
You know it's Spaldin' in my top, I'm in my esperanza
You know it's slammin' wall to wall

I had to leave, like the leaves do trees
I'm finally home, I wiped the stress, then I touched that sweat
We took 'em 35 to 1 like this shit roulette
Hold up, beg your pardon, we done lit up, baby
Set up, told the preacher, ""Never finish,"" that's to say the least
Buy it, never lease it, but I gotta lease it
Mobile, Mona type of pieces, Met Gala, night Jesus
Skip it, hit the city, party pack, I got it with me
I'm shotty while I let you with me
I'm too bent to let you ride, barely 'til it's empty
Gotta feel me, pockets dumb fat and I got a skinny
Squad is with me, and that's everything I know about it

My momma always ask me 'bout my attitude
Damn, momma, I don't know at all
I met this chick who want to meet me at the avenue
I had a feeling we'd have a ball
She knows stars, I know that, she want cars, I want jets
She want to get eloped, but I don't know yet
Pick up my fur after sitting, hanging in the coat check
Give me calls, she pick me off, I didn't hit the door yet
Damn, I'm sorry, but that bitch gon' be looking love sick
All on TV, crying to Maury, looking love sick
While I'm probably in the Rari, going Audi, fucking with molly
And we running on E, not the gas, but the molly
And she fucking with me so she came to have a party
Now she leaving with me, now you're love sick

So when you close your eyes
Do you picture us havin' a hell of a night? Oh

[Verse 2]
Dinner time, I'm dining out with a porn star
She remind me of home, L.A., our second home
See see we met at Leon, plenty empty bottles of Lonestar
Conversation was long, how she landed from Rome
Yeah, she did
Later on that night I got her back to the crib
Kicked off My Will&Rich and got her down to her skin
After all she got a little taste test of my kids
You know what, we used to dream about this
A couple models and cribs, way fresher than movies
Should of know it was fake, I could tell by the boobies
Treated life like a safe, load it up and then blew me
Yeah, she did
Head so good, it ain't even cost me
Woke up, she gone, look what I lost
Sheepskin' it at all, and it all-ladidida

[Intro: Chuck Senrick & James Blake]
Have you ever been lost?
Have you ever been lost?
Forever

[Verse: Travis Scott, James Blake & Chuck Senrick]
Lost on islands, driven in boat cars
Just bring your girl, feel like she both ours
Young black nigga work at the Auchans (Auchans)
So how we here trapped on the ocean?
'Bout to go up a level of disrespectful
I'm just one chain away from goin' heavy metal
I'm just one angel away from blockin' out the devil
Just one mountain away from meetin' all my rebels
Too much power, too many hours all in a day
I sent her flowers, ain't talkin roses, I'm talkin' maoda
Ask if she ""ha-ha-ha"", I wouldn't doubt it
Took her through the Hills at noon, she felt the (And how wonderful, how wonderful)
Baby girl think she in Honolu' (Wonderful)
Don't you know you in the I-5 loop? (How wonderful)
How many chickens fit in the coupe? (How wonderful, wonderful)
Wonderful, she don't wanna leave
She jump up, bounce back like trampoline (Have you ever been lost?)

Custom the things, custom the wings
I had to custom the vibe, custom the link up
Cover the back of the lab, front cover magazine
Cover your eyes, cuddled up, back of the V (Yeah)
Our chemistry, just like the trappers and fiends (Ooh)
Our misery really ain't nothin' to see
I gotta travel the V, I like to travel to heat (Ooh)
Bring out a bag of the weed
Did I tell you I got my own weed? I had a lot to achieve
Blew it out and I'm relieved, take it down, now you relieve
Rather you leave, then you go back out on me
Don't throw no daggers at me, you gotta shoot 'em at least
You know my Dodge supreme, I put in hours this week
Movin' at rapid speed, like it's a track, we meet
We got a timeless thing, we gotta find some Zs, yeah

Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked

Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck
City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust

Like it thick with a bounce, we all in the count
Wine bottles cost 'bout a couch, you on the way with the wave
Stacks in my pouch, you know it jump at the house
You come with two when it's late, know the brown one is my fav'
Then Mike Brown gon' walk you out (Walk you out)
Step by step, watch yourself
Cleaners got anything you might've left
I couldn't do none of this by myself
With mafia, they in the tuck
I gave you fifty to boost up your butt
I gave you the juice, you'd rather get buzzed
I tried to choose you, you'd rather go club
Know what to do, you rattled me up
Common denominator, we were steps from the diamond ages
Got a couple of vibrations

They got them pornstar big booties
Let me film it, then shoot it

Depending if I'm feelin' bougie

Famous hoes lame, but they stay on my dick
Heard your new joint, it's embarrassing, shit
You talk to the cops on some therapist shit
You act like you love this American shit
But, really, the truth is you scared of the 6
Yeah, you scared of the 6
Yeah, you scared of the 6
Your bodyguard put in some work on a fluke
Now you wanna go and inherit that shit
Don't talk to the boy 'bout comparisons, shit
Or come to the boy on some arrogant shit
The weapons we got are some terrorist shit
Like TV producers we, grr, we airing this shit
She askin' for bread for her parents and shit
I told her I don't got no cash and she said she could wait on a rack, on some Arabic shit
I pull out a million and stare at the shit
My dick just got hard 'cause a wire just hit
My schedule is out, come spin us, for real
Man, fuck all that spinnin' the narrative shit
I melt down the chains that I bought from yo' boss
Give a fuck about all of that heritage shit
Since V not around, the members done hung up the Louis, they not even wearing that shit
Don't come to the boy 'bout repairing some shit
Don't come to the boy about sparing some shit

Ain't nobody fight tonight except for the bartenders

Me and my homies got the loot so we tryin' to boot
Her and her breast full off the booze, it's a party for two
Hotel room numbers and late night food runners
Summary of the whole summer, but can't seem to remember
From the fall of September, most of we can't remember
From the Spring to the Winter, couldn't tell you my dinner
Wish I could tell you what I did back in my past life
So how the hell you think I could tell you 'bout last night? (Last night)

Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' no FaceTime

Emboldеned by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Late from thе country caters
No peacemaker, I sweep up cases
Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a hammer
Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T-T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beefin' up, fuck a beef

Look in my eyes, tell me your tale
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a sea of people that ride wit' me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me inspired (Hah)
Yeah, yeah
That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
I run it for miles, this shit wasn't luck
They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around
A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
They say they the ones when they make the errors
Can't look in the mirror (That shit wild)
I stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
We do in the streets, we do it for keeps
We do it for rights, got fifty-two weeks
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me a bean and I turn to a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink24Embed"

Picture being locked in a box
Selling beats 'cause you need dollars
They say I can make it to the league, mama

Tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin' up the stove
Was close to stealing and killing, now just to get 'em on
Couple drinks down of Rosé
I'm tipsy, y'all faces done look like an emoji
The RAV4 turned into a Rover
'Til it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now our money a little longer
Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know shit
They gave me three, got twenty-five on the low
Who knew that lump sum would get me on?
My fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer
I can shit all day, diaper
Call that eat-all-day; itis

3 AM rolling stoned, all I see is dust
We feel like rock stars then we rockstars
Sex pistol posers, they never heard of us
I guess I need that white broad in that white car
So raise your glasses homie cause we seem to bring the masses homie
And shut down our whole town, fuck up shit
My homie Jon copped them grapes and they busted
Rollies and raviolis you in the cover of Vogue
Don't look between the lines or it'll fuck up your mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind

[Chorus]
But the nights keep fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey

[Verse 2]
Summertime was the illest
Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told 'em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But fuck motto, when her breasts out tell em take some fucking photos
Fill up the dressing room with Will and Rich and Quasimodos
So we popped the champagne so drunk
Spilled liquor all over her Vera Wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different don't it
So I'mma shine while I'm here make it mine while I'm here

Pornography,"158 ContributorsTranslationsTravis Scott - Pornography (Azərbaycan Tərcümə)PortuguêsEspañolFrançaisSvenskaTürkçePornography Lyrics[Part I]
[Intro: T.I.]
Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of ""Fuck this shit""
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life
But wherever it is, it's better than here, so fuck you, and fuck this

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights—, lights—, lights—
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

[Bridge: Travis Scott]

And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

[Segue: T.I.]
The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive, or will he fold up?
Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say ""Fuck you""
To the ones who said ""Fuck you""
'Til you doing ya thing, codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
""La Flame,"" he hears in his head, ""The world is yours"" (Yours, yours)

Wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga

Houston nigga goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects
Wonder why a nigga went cold-hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking could you hold one?
Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them
Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him
But I'm way too young to be the old him
I'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom
'Til I climb to the top of the podium

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
So wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish
[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
We gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world
We gon' rule the world, hmm
Never gonna stop, never gonna stop, never ever gonna stop it!

Oh, oh, don't pray for love
Oh, oh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Weeknd]
Pray for who lost they fate and died too young
Pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off in this club
I pray that the demons go away, they hauntin' us
Man, I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been living
Man, I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab up J-Will, gotta scoop up J-Rich
Told Chase we ain't going back, you know we gotta hitch
I mean, I'm aggravated, agitated, I admit
Intoxicated, animated, got me feeling kinda lit
Contemplating fornicating, might as well fuck up some shit
They looking at me way too crazy, got me feeling communist
But I'm just trying to save the throne, pray for Bones, pray for Stix (Just ask the lonely)
If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick
Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him buzz me at the Ritz (Just ask the lonely)
It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us

Let me tell the lost tale about Jacques
Let me tell you how I turned Scott
How I went down on the block
Waterfall around ten o'clock
And how we came up getting all the knots, dodging cops, yeah
'Fore a nigga had the locks (Just ask the lonely)
'Fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops
Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch (Just ask the lonely)
Every time we in the party, took it up a notch
Now I'm thinking 'bout this new girl, and she doing pop (Oh-oh)
Wanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box
(Don't pray for love)
Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Oh-oh)
And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (Say it loud)
Mama, don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more (Just ask the lonely)

Underrated is an understatement
They tryna test greatness, a nigga tryna get paid
These niggas fiends watching all of my moves
'Cause the music like crack, got me cooking all day
I'm right here, you know where I stay
And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way
She like my show lights, she wanna be wifey
She know that if she got me then she gon' be good for life
So I pull out for the climax, faster than a hi-hat
Sorry, baby, I don't play
And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'
And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me
My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce
Like they sell that coke, boy, shout out to the Coke Boys
They never pray for us, nobody pray for us
Nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Notorious B.I.G.]
(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
**** **** way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colorеd chains, think my jeweler rеally sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, **** treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that ****!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""

Run from home, after tonight, we up out of here
Don't go home 'cause they just ran me up out of there
Fuck the streetlights, she ran the street tight
She run her mouth, but can't eat right?
Don't read between the lines and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby, you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless?
The Rollie on me only 'cause to tell what the time is
We lost in the city where sin is no biggy

Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Notorious B.I.G]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big when we pull up give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mix this pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

No, no, no, no, no
This shit way too formal, y'all know I don’t follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls a*** got a clue
All of these **** I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my esés, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her ""hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that-pop that)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said ""where we goin'?"" I said ""the moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

I'm on top now, still comin' down, but never fallin' off, yeah
I might need the distance, all I need is time, time
Can't even look at my phone line
Without a couple texts that I can't deny
Locked the phone, I had to close my eyes
Half the time, man, they tellin' lies
Who to trust? Man, I can't decide
Nowadays, we just don't reply
But they know my name, they compare it, still
We was busting seals before we had a mil'
We done had the grills before we had a deal
I'm a Houston nigga, that's what made me here

You should be done with me

Like the covers come off in the heat
We don't have to lie
We don't have to lie right here
And it's alright
I should've waited somehow
I shouldn't have pushed so hard
I always push too hard
And now it's just a blackout
And now it's just a blackout
(Somehow)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
My mama always told me, ""Put yourself first""
I don't really fall in love with women, man, 'cause love hurt
I hit a couple broads, I can't lie, I put my dick first
Now you runnin' 'round playin' payback and that shit hurt
I should've treated you better (21)
Used to deal with lames 'til she ran into a stepper (On God)
Big dawg Savage, I'm a Zone 6 repper (21)
Niggas throwin' salt, but the Draco came with pepper (Straight up)
She say we ain't goin' nowhere 'cause all I do is sext her (On God)
Woah, never knew that I had to propose, no (21)
I was fine with you bein' one of my hoes, for sure (On God)
She said she seen us bein' somebody goals, what are those? (21)
I thought about givin' you the key to my heart, but it's froze

Drinkin' help balance the patience, watch how you take it

Leave me faded, I feel painless
I go out gracious
I'm tryna feel the shade of greatness by celebratin'
Bring entertainment, goin' brainless, like goin' dumb on my hiatus
She fall more in love every time that I tip
I fade away every time that I

Comin' up from nothing, you know you gon' have to hustle
Thru all of the pain and the struggle, so momma don't move a muscle again
And I know you gonna feel me through a pad and a pen
Because it's no other escape with all the feelings within

Killing shit for years and never did I gettin' acknowledged

Quit tripping we having a toast

All on the boat showing her boobies the most
Lets toss her and see if she float
We pulled over the car at the liquor store
And if these bitches ain't fresh as me, then what we in here for?

Easily, just roll up the dope and watch me turn it to smoke and go

To get your skills up, to pass the bar hmm

In 8 days i make 2 worlds
One up in god
They said I'm wako looney satan
I get fucked up so ofton
I don't see life in problemo's
I made it through the tunnel faster than old people
Trying to ? pharmaceuticals ?
My life's lowkey i don't need many doors
Surviving in a world that makes me a businessman
But it makes that girl a whore, no more, be gone, you a whore
I'm Americon no comment on it
I got many things to say, i might vomit
Bitch grab the karmet and clean it up, we outta here on the ? spaceship to the bahamas
Take up our armors, im going bonkers, listen to the Grim Reaper ?

Are you wasted or nah? Wasted or nah? Wasted or nah?

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Take a sip, drowning in this shit, coppers on my hip, I hold my head
I've been taking risks to make that money flip, shots to the head
I ain't order it, I can't afford this shit
Go to war with this you overboard, I'm over bored with shit
Now, it's pay up player, pay a nigga
Gotta day to day to stack and still I pay accountants
Twenty racks to show just a little allowance
Only come to Houston if the boy allow it
Bow your head to a real one, coming down with them main niggas
H-Town, don't play with us, them wit-it boys stay wit-wit-wit it
I've been grinding, slaving over time since I was a fan
Looking in the mirror like ""One day, Jacques, you gon' be the man""
One skinny, tatted nigga, blunt flicker
Young La Flame, hot spitter who can't hold his liquor, yah
[Chorus: Pimp C]
It's really going down in the goddamn South

Is you wasted, baby?
One shot, two shots and you still talking crazy (Trippy)
Three shots and you faded
Freaks coming out at night and they gettin' X rated
Four shots now she wanna do the clique
Any more shots she ain't gon' remember shit
Smoking on extendos, no clips
Project hoes going up in the Ritz (Trippy)
She gon' do it for a G, anything for me, bruh
She just wanna fuck and drink and chief all the weed up
Sexy bitch, pop that pussy 'cause you in your prime
Pour that purple over ice, call it ""turtle time""
Shawty never been a hesitator
Got her going down on the elevator
Heard the pussy bomb, I'ma detonate her
Fuck her from the back, keep the neck for later
No magic trick, but I levitate her
With the magic stick, nothing less than great
When I hit her with the dope D, I'm gone
Don't text me later, no extra favors
[Chorus: Pimp C]
It's really going down in the goddamn South

Hmm, weed, lean, MDMA, he say, she say
All the products of a young man gone the long way
From the home that he knew, 'til he roamed where he at
And the phone break up, unknown wake up
Several one night stands, hung up phone, break up
If he fall, will he fly? Sure, wouldn't take much
For you to find out, jump, if you took that plunge
If not, we're in the same spot, how could you judge?
H-h-how could you judge? C-c-could you judge?52Embed"

Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari

She pulled out the hard white on the highway for the line
Listen, pimping your bitches might visit my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up crib look like the tele, left jelly all over her biscuit

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number 4s
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watchin' my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said, ""I'll be there in ten,"" but I got there in four

I left her wide open, no self control ('Trol, 'trol, 'trol)
Mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm

Mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm

[Chorus: Gunna & Travis Scott]
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes (Flawless baguettes)
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check (Check)
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest (Drip)
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex (Checks)
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed (Shine, yeah)
Two-tone Pateks (Mmm-mmm-mmm)
In The Clearport like I Uber the jets (Jets)

You know when I was fourteen
I wanted to do a lot of kick ass shit
Yeah, ah

[Verse 2]
Pornographic, so dramatic, cinematic
Diamond flashes, so jurassic, dress so classic
Roll that cabbage, get put in casket, you dope fanatic
You the baddest, I'm sarcastic, we both laughin'
I'm the baddest, I'm out in traffic, four engine backin'
Stuffed in Suburban, twelve bitches straight out the beauty pageant
You know Reebok keep La feet hot, they be shipping package
GL 600 or the Palace, that collab with Classics
Tell me what you need, I got everything green
Money, money, money trees, I buy everything
That bitch need no wedding ring, she need a bean (Uh)
That boy walked in mall, that boy he need a beam (Don't)
I done fucked her twice, you bought her Fendi things
I done sipped the Act', now I'ma leany fiend (Don't)

Gotta stay down, you ain't got no zoom
Big rock, diamonds, Yao Ming yoom (Yeah)
Purple lemonade, puffin' out them fumes
Heatin' up like last day in June (Ha)
Niggas stealin' my drip, that shit ain't cool
See, Eliantte let me polish my jewels
I cherish her face, I pay for her groom (Yeah)
No time to waste so I'm takin' off soon
Cash out on drip, tryna fly to the moon
Lookin' like, ""Who is he?"" Gunna no runner, he move like me, yeah
Got foreigns, a movin' fleet, tote choppers like ""Who is security?""
I fly her right in, then meet up at the room
She don't know your name, but she know all my tunes
I pass it to Los, and he shot it to Junes
You can't try none the brothers, the brothers try you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Gunna]
If you try one of us, you get put on the news (Yeah)
Pull up in that new Bentley truck, I didn't come here to lose
Made it to Clearport, forgot to say she had a dude
Bag full of money and all of these hunnids is blue
I know you proud of me, AP, I don't do apologies
High tune on my Prada tee, purchase on my new Amiri jeans
Young Gunna drip god, I fly with no wings
I let her use my card to secure her needs (Yeah)
Had to tell her girl these pearls, not beads (Yeah)
