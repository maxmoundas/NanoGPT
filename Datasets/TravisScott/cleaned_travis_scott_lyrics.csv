"12 Disciples","Chorus
Im floatin high, dont talk to me
Im rollin high, dont bother me
So follow me, yeah, come and follow me
In the night streets, dim the lights, please

Verse 1
What the fuck they want? Im drunk as hell
Fuck work today, I wanna get some tail
Damn my little nigga graduated, man, I wish him well Now theres no more breaking them pies
And making that bail for them scales
Step across that fence and thats your life
When I run that town, that whip about town size
Four chains, they hang on my neck, was dipped in that brown rice
You think something wrong cause your shit dont shine bright
But aint nothing wrong cause your shit dont shine bright

Chorus
Im floatin high, dont talk to me
Im rollin high, dont bother me
So follow me, yeah, come and follow me
In the night streets, dim the lights, please

Verse 2
It was Friday, what a night, what a situation
My nigga Chase momma called cause he missed that graduation
He told her, Momma please, have a drink, have a little bit patience
Cause soon we would be riding in a car with a little ventilation
Pastor said that we gotta move to congregation
Im looking for salvation, but Im drowning in the revelations
XX revolution, this inauguration to the whole nation
If it aint no head, no sex, then its masturbation
Chorus
Im floatin high, dont talk to me
Im rollin high, dont bother me
So follow me, yeah, come and follow me
In the night streets, dim the lights, please17"
"16 Chapels","Chorus
I dont know about you
Feel like Im floating through the night
Slow move to the groove
Often the feeling feels right
Dance like a 90s baby
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
Feel like Im floating through traffic
Then it poof like magic

Verse 1: Travis Scott
This shit be the coldest
Wake up nigga, smell the Folgers
Fuck she throwing up last night
Only if the dumb bitch did what I told her Told her
She feel me, I feel her
And she even let me move my fingers up her skirt
Fuck it live for the moment
Had no bread, now the hoes spread like toast is
Her legs spread like Moses
On my way, raise your glass we can have a toast
To the same ones that love talking that wild shit
Be the same ones who wanna be around the most
Tony said soon enough niggas will have a two-tone
Two blond chicks with the roof gone
Complaining now that her breasts out
Well at least you couldve thought to put the mink on
Chorus
I dont know about you
Feel like Im floating through the night
Slow move to the groove
Often the feeling feels right
Dance like a 90s, baby
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
Feel like Im floating through traffic
Then it poof like magic

Verse 2: Travis Scott
Wet dreams with the prom queen
Now Im tryna screw me a centerfold
Every nigga have their wild dreams
Mines is to fly to the summer in my winter clothes
Sin city is a mile away
I see the devil in a skirt, but its a nightgown
Hallelujah, does it even matter if its night or day
When we pull up, she gon pull her shirt down
This where we find em
Same niggas that sniff Donna
And get drunk off the mimosa
Space green or designer
Hermes based off of drama
Call it spendin yoda
Six years catch me trying yoga
In the Caesar Palace rocking a toga
Throwing a toga party
Chilling with your bitch and she extra naughty
Chorus
I dont know about you
I dont know about you
Dance like a 90s, baby
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
Feel like Im floating through traffic
Then it poof like magic
I dont know about you
Feel like Im floating through the night
Slow move to the groove
Often the feeling feels right
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
Feel like Im floating through traffic
Then it poof like magic18"

Where the weather is warm

Verse 1: Travis Scott
Moonlight move when a nigga dance
Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasnt working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they cant wait
In the moonlight, you cant see my eyes
And when Im off the things I cant think
Man I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga cant choke
When they recognize a real nigga still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat

Chorus: Theophilus London
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Lets get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long
Verse 2: Travis Scott
Lost in the moonlight, run through the moonlight, who knew?
Cop lights, no lights, cause the bills they was overdue
Now a skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking trips to the side of the moon
Had to take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed a little cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, you dont wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
Im on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just gon cruise hit the brews, lay back dont worry bout shit
It might get rowdy cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, its so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it cant be realer, me and my niggas in the villa
She in that white dress it cant fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it and she on the moon my nigga

Paul Wall, two cups, hold up, hold up
Im headed to the moon cause the world screwed up
Like the city, I grew up so
Im pouring up a co-cup, bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you spill my cup, itll get you fucked up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG
In the triple D, Im full when Im on E, you dont know nothing bout me
Backwood feel with a Compton tree
Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt but I aint no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco, piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that shit
Def rocking link, what you know about this
Baby Bash came through with the kush assist
Percocet ten and a soma twist on the moon
Getting higher than a bitch and Im doing my dance

Raised in a town where it looked so good outside

Now he stuck in a cell, know he feeling nauseous

See see we met at Leon, plenty empty bottles of Lonestar
Conversation was long, how she landed from Rome

Later on that night I got her back to the crib
Kicked off My Will&Rich and got her down to her skin
After all she got a little taste test of my kids
You know what, we used to dream about this
A couple models and cribs, way fresher than movies
Should of know it was fake, I could tell by the boobies
Treated life like a safe, load it up and then blew me
Yeah, she did

Blew it out and Im relieved, take it down, now you relieve

Stacks in my pouch, you know it jump at the house
You come with two when its late, know the brown one is my fav

Step by step, watch yourself
Cleaners got anything you mightve left
I couldnt do none of this by myself
With mafia, they in the tuck
I gave you fifty to boost up your butt
I gave you the juice, youd rather get buzzed
I tried to choose you, youd rather go club
Know what to do, you rattled me up
Common denominator, we were steps from the diamond ages
Got a couple of vibrations
For the simulation, gotta re-up the hydration

Look in my eyes, tell me your tale
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a sea of people that ride wit me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me inspired Hah

I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
I run it for miles, this shit wasnt luck
They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around
A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave em the tools to get it off ground
They say they the ones when they make the errors
Cant look in the mirror That shit wild
I stand on the stage, I give em the rage
No turnin it down, cant tame it, cant follow it
We do in the streets, we do it for keeps
We do it for rights, got fifty-two weeks
This shit aint for pleasure, Im comin to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me a bean and I turn to a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didnt buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon cheat

Gon have to burn this roof down for these niggas to understand
And what we fucking for? For the lights in the night
The way yours eyes glow, you make me want to have your sight
Damn I dug my own trenches, yeah, I hide my own pistols
I survived in the coldest winter, these beats is my only dinner
You cant blame a nigga, they tryna hang a nigga
I mean like every time a nigga blink Im throwing on the mink
And she dont want to dance unless she drink
Will this Pharaoh make it out his sphinx?
Bookmarked a lot haters, I added more links
Rolling with the same niggas who was rolling with niggas that was on E
Wonder why I see the stars in the afternoon
Floating at night when you can catch me right under the moon17"

"Never Catch Me","Verse
She take a shot of Hennessy

Picture being locked in a box
Selling beats cause you need dollars
They say I can make it to the league, mama
500 dollars all we need, mama
Then we gon be on
Tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin up the stove
Was close to stealing and killing, now just to get em on
Couple drinks down of Ros
Im tipsy, yall faces done look like an emoji
The RAV4 turned into a Rover
Til it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now our money a little longer
Lookin back how we finnesin, we aint know shit
They gave me three, got twenty-five on the low
Who knew that lump sum would get me on?
My fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer
I can shit all day, diaper
Call that eat-all-day; itis
Will I ever fall off? I doubt it
Chorus
No, no, no, no
All these diamonds shinin
All this gold on me, all these foes on us
How do I dodge these zombies?
They want my soul from me

Falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off, falling off

I guess I need that white broad in that white car
So raise your glasses homie cause we seem to bring the masses homie
And shut down our whole town, fuck up shit
My homie Jon copped them grapes and they busted
Rollies and raviolis you in the cover of Vogue
Dont look between the lines or itll fuck up your mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind

Summertime was the illest
Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But fuck motto, when her breasts out tell em take some fucking photos
Fill up the dressing room with Will and Rich and Quasimodos
So we popped the champagne so drunk
Spilled liquor all over her Vera Wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different dont it
So Imma shine while Im here make it mine while Im here

"Pornography","Part I
Intro: T.I.
Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of Fuck this shit
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Aint made it to wherever the fuck they gon be in life
But wherever it is, its better than here, so fuck you, and fuck this

Chorus: Travis Scott
No monogamy, mnage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me

All these flashing lights, lights, lights
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, thats all I need in my fantasy

You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
Ima rub a dub, tryna get a nut
Chorus: Travis Scott
No monogamy, mnage with me

Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, thats all I need in my fantasy

Segue: T.I.
The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive, or will he fold up?
Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits cant wait to get a chance to say Fuck you
To the ones who said Fuck you
Til you doing ya thing, codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
La Flame, he hears in his head, The world is yours Yours, yours

"XXL Freshman Freestyle: Travis Scott","Lifted, Im feeling so gifted, tripping, Im constantly falling
Channel view of the whole villa, plotting while burning a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whipping the Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches dont know, I teach em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, since shes lamping with the trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway for the line
Listen, pimping your bitches might visit my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up crib look like the tele, left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth, I copped it but now I dont miss it
World found it, teeth probably glissing, in fact that nigga prolly missing
